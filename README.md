# tsboilerplate

A simple way for me to spin up typescript/vanilla projects, with a tiny library
of common features that i have the tendancy to use.

## Features

### Dev
- `npm run dev` to spin up a lite server, that auto refreshes...


### Services
- Http service - simple wrapper for restful requests
- Cookie service - easier handling of cookies
